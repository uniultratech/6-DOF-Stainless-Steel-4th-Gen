## Finishing up
Congratulations, you have finished assembling the arm. 

*** Notice if you have our PS2 controller kit, you might only see 6 servo ports, please note that the dual arm part could still work with only one of the servo being plugged in, so please only plug in one of the servo at the dual arm part, either top or bottom will work. Having powers to both servos require more programming and engineering knowledges, please use them at your own risks. Thank you again for choosing UniUltra Tech. ***
